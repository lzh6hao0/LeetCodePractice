编写一个函数来查找字符串数组中的最长公共前缀。

如果不存在公共前缀，返回空字符串 ""。

示例 1:

输入: ["flower","flow","flight"]
输出: "fl"
示例 2:

输入: ["dog","racecar","car"]
输出: ""
解释: 输入不存在公共前缀。
说明:

所有输入只包含小写字母 a-z 。、




Array.Sort(arrays,IComparer)
This method uses the introspective sort (introsort) algorithm as follows:

If the partition size is less than or equal to 16 elements, it uses an insertion sort algorithm.

If the number of partitions exceeds 2 * LogN, where N is the range of the input array, it uses a Heapsort algorithm.

Otherwise, it uses a Quicksort algorithm.

This implementation performs an unstable sort; that is, if two elements are equal, their order might not be preserved. In contrast, a stable sort preserves the order of elements that are equal.

This method is an O(n log n) operation, where n is the Length of array.
